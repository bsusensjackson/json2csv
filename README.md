Client Side CSV Generator 

This is a simple library (with no dependencies) for parsing JSON into CSV that your users can download. 


Call it with:
```
csvConverter.convert(myJSON);
```

This will open a new window in the user's browser that automatically downloads the new CSV! 

Works on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE11. 

Test suite / node module coming soon...
